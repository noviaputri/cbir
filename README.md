# Image Retrieval Project

# Overview
The application makes use of CNN Auto Encoder to extract features of an image to be saved as a trained model. Then, these model is used to find similar images when a new image is given as input. Euclidean distance is calculated to find the similarity between two feature vectors (a and b). And then comparing all feature vectors for similarity and returning the results.
